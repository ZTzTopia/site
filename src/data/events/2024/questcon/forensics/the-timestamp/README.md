## Scenario

> Scenario:
>
> The Professor and his crew have pulled off their biggest heist yet, but the police are hot on their trail. During their digital forensics investigation, the authorities have stumbled upon a critical file, malware.exe, on a suspect's computer. The timestamps on the file could reveal key details about the heist timeline, but it seems that the crew has altered them to cover their tracks!
>
> The investigators suspect that Berlin, the mastermind behind the digital side of the operation, used a tool called Timestomp to manipulate the timestamps and throw the authorities off their trail. But with the right tools, you, as a digital forensics expert, can uncover the truth.
> 
> The $MFT (Master File Table) has been exported from the system, and the police have analyzed it using the AnalyzeMFT tool. Now itâ€™s up to you to figure out whether Berlin tampered with the file's timestamps and uncover the real modification time of the file.

## Solution

The challenge provides a file named `analyze_mft_output.txt` and a file named `malware_mft.json`. The `analyze_mft_output.txt` file contains the output of the `AnalyzeMFT` tool and the `malware_mft.json` file contains the metadata of the `malware.exe` file.

The `analyze_mft_output.txt` file contains two `Modified` timestamps. The first `Modified` timestamp is `2023-01-15 12:00:00` and the second `Modified` timestamp is `2023-01-17 09:30:45`. The second `Modified` timestamp represents the actual modification time of the file. This is because the first timestamp might be related to metadata changes or other non-content modifications, whereas the second timestamp reflects the true content modification time. We can extract the real modification time of the file from the `analyze_mft_output.txt` file.
