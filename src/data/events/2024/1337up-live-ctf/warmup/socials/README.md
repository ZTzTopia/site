## Solution

The challenge provides a link to the Intigriti Linktree page, which contains links to the Intigriti Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit accounts. The objective is to search through these social media platforms to find the flags.

After visiting the Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit accounts, I found the following flags from CryptoCat's comments.

### Twitter

In twitter we found CryptoCat's comment in one of the Intigriti's tweets:

```
0110100000110000011100000011001101011111011110010011000001110101
```

After decoding the binary data, we get the partial flag:

```
h0p3_y0u
```
