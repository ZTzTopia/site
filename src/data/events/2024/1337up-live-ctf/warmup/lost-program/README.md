## Scenario

> I was working on a bug bounty program the other day but I completely forgot the name!! I guess that will teach me not to use emoji notation in future 😩 Anyway, if you could help me find it again, I'd really appreciate it! Here's my notes..

## Solution

The hint given in the challenge is `TODO: find lots of 😎🐛 on 🥷🥝🎮`. The emojis are representing the words `cool`, `bugs`, `ninja`, `kiwi`, and `games`. The company name is `ninja kiwi games`. So the flag is `INTIGRITI{ninja_kiwi_games}`.
