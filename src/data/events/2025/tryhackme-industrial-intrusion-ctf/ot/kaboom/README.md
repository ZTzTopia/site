> This challenge drops you into the shoes of the APT operator: With a single crafted Modbus, you over-pressurise the main pump, triggering a thunderous blow-out that floods the plant with alarms. While chaos reigns, your partner ghosts through the shaken DMZ and installs a stealth implant, turning the diversion’s echo into your persistent beachhead.
