Continuing from OSINT 1, we identified another subdomain associated with the domain `virelia-water.it.com`. The subdomain is `uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com`. This discovery was made during further analysis of the domain's hosting infrastructure.

To understand the purpose of the variable `beacon` found in the repository, we consulted ChatGPT. The explanation revealed that `beacon` is likely related to DNS functionality, possibly used for communication or signaling purposes within the infrastructure.

To investigate the subdomain further, we used the `dig` command to query its TXT records. The command used was:

```sh
$ dig TXT uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com

; <<>> DiG 9.20.9-1-Debian <<>> TXT uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 57381

uplink-fallback.virelia-water.it.com. 1799 IN TXT "REDACTEDBASE64="

```

This command queries the DNS server for TXT records associated with the subdomain. TXT records often contain metadata or encoded information.

The query revealed a Base64 encoded string in the TXT record. This encoded string was then decoded to extract the flag.
