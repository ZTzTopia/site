So we have a game that we can play. We can play the game and see that we have to wait for `17800` seconds to get the flag.

We can use `Cheat Engine` to change the value of the timer to `0` and get the flag. Search for the value like `3600` or `86400` and change it to `0`.

Another method is to **manually change the system time** far into the future, which tricks the game into thinking the wait time has elapsed.
