Given a website that uses `Next.js`. This website has a feature to view pending requests. Since there are no interesting network requests, i tried to look at the source code of this website.

In the source code i found a path `/v2-testing` in the `_buildManifest.js` file. i tried to access the path and found a form asking for input and a filter.

After filtering we can see on the network that it will make a request to `/api/list-v2` with the `POST` method. I tried to do **SQL Injection** with the payload `' OR 1=1 --` and managed to get the flag.

Payload:

```json
{
  "filter": "' OR 1=1 --"
}
```
