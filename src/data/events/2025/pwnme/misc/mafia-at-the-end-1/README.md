Another PCAP challenge. This time we have a PCAP file with a lot of traffic. We found the IRC traffic.

Following the TCP stream and we found chat messages.

In the chat, we found the contract address `0xCAB0b02864288a9cFbbd3d004570FEdE2faad8F8`, because the contract is deployed on the sepolia network, we can find the contract on the [etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
